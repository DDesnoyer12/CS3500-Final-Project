# CS4430-Final-Project

Creators: Daniel Desnoyer, Richad Schaefer, & Mathew Schutz

Due Date: April 18, 2018

Description: Our final project for this class is an Overwatch forum/fan website.

Half of the website is a database dedicated to stats and other information on all of Overwatch's
heroes and maps, including abilities, damage, difficulties, and competitive rankings.
The other half of the website is a dedicated forum for the game, where users can create an account
and log on to post topics under various different categories of the game.
