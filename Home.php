		<h1>What is Overwatch?</h1>
		<hr><br \>
		<h2>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. 
		It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player 
		selecting from a roster of pre-defined characters, known as heroes, each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four 
		general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or 
		escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character 
		skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 
		'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed 
		and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional 
		cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.</h2>
